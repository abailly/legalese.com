## Why current contract drafting is terrible

* [The 10M dollar serial comma](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-few-words-about-that-ten-million-dollar-serial-comma)

* [Ken Adams on Contract Drafting](https://twitter.com/KonciseD/status/816827816125677568): "Am I restoring order to contract drafting? No, there never was a golden age of drafting, it's always been a mess." -- 4 Jan 2017

## There is a better way
* The British Nationality Act was [rewritten in Prolog](http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~sok/papers/s/p370-sergot.pdf) all the way back in 1986!

## The closest material thus far
* [Contract as Automaton: The Computational Representation of Financial Agreements](https://financialresearch.gov/working-papers/files/OFRwp-2015-04_Contract-as-Automaton-The-Computational-Representation-of-Financial-Agreements.pdf)
* [Contract Formalization by Tom Hvitved](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxOaYa8pqqSwbl9GMWtwVU5HSFU)
* The [Anacon framework](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~gersch/anacon/)
* [Contracts in Structured English and Back](https://heim.ifi.uio.no/gerardo/flacos11-GFCL.pdf)

## Sketching the way forward

* [Logic in the Theory and Practice of Lawmaking](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3308162/Logic%20in%20the%20Theory%20and%20Practice%20of%20Lawmaking.pdf)


## Generating English from Formal Grammars (Isomorphism)
There exists a lovely framework for generating multi-lingual natural language from formal grammars.  It's called GrammaticalFramework.  As a lawyer, you'll probably be good at generating the appropriate natural language. The plan is to build a dictionary of translation of the smallest "atomic" units of logic to legal, then compose these fragments into larger texts.
